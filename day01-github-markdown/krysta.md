### Week 1 Meme

I chose this meme because I like The Office, and it accurately describes how this week is going for me (most weeks, actually).

### Methods for Sharing My Work Online

I've heard that data scientists are supposed to have portfolios, but that has been something that has largely been neglected in this program (not just the act of creating one but giving us opportunities to create content for it with our course work). Right now, I can see myself doing this with a website vs a blog and using R packages such as {rmarkdown}, {blogdown}, and {distill} to do this. I'm excited to have the opportunity to play around with distill in this course!

### Websites/Blogs/Portfolios That I have Explored

Currently, I don not follow any websites, blogs, or people who do data science work or work that is related to data science. When I'm not doing homework I enjoy taking a break from data science and doing other things. The only thing I do in my free time that is tech or data science related is listen to the podcast Your Unidivided Attention from the Center of Humane Technology. As I continue my journey outside of the university setting, continue having new experiences and meeting new people, and continue being introduced to new ideas, I hope to find my path.
