### Week 1 Meme

![The Office meme](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7f/3c/f9/7f3cf9c37c0150acfa20deaee439f67d.jpg)

I chose this meme because I like The Office, and it accurately describes how this week is going for me (most weeks, actually).
It is appropriate for a professional setting (I have one where Dwight is talking about excitement which is not) and the humor isn't overly dark.

### Methods for Sharing My Work Online

I've heard that data scientists are supposed to have portfolios, but that has been something that has largely been neglected in this program (not just the act of creating one but giving us opportunities to create content for it with our course work). Right now, I can see myself doing this with a website vs a blog and using R packages ({rmarkdown}, {blogdown}, {distill}) to do this. I'm excited to have the opportunity to play around with distill in this course!

### Websites/Blogs/Portfolios That I have Explored

I like the idea of analyzing data and then writing about it (I can use my writing minor!).

I browsed many of the websites/blogs/portfolios on Bradford's list.

Right now...

 ```{r library-example, eval = FALSE}
  library(tidyverse)
  library(tidymodels)
  ```
`{tidymodels}`
