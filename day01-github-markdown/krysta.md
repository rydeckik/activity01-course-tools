I chose this meme because I like The Office, and it accurately describes how this week is going for me (most weeks, actually).
It is appropriate for a professional setting (I have one where Dwight is talking about excitement which is not) and the humor isn't overly dark.


Explore websites/blogs/portfolios of multiple people doing work that you either are in awe of or that you would like to be doing yourself.

As far as work that I am in awe of or that I would like to be doing myself, I've got nothing. 
I don't follow anyone, I don't read any blogs, I don't even know how I would come across any of this.
I feel like data scientists are (for lack of a better term) the prostitutes of the business world. 
We have a unique, in-demand skill set that businesses pay good money for.
The last thing I ever feel when looking at job descriptions is inspired.
I would love to be inspired, but that hasn't really happened yet.

For over 4 years now, my goal has been to get a big girl job (not a server), be financially independent, and have a healthy work-life balance.
I need to make it through this program (which it looks like I am going to do) so i can get on with my life.



I need something to direct my attention. 

I have no idea what I will be doing.
I have no idea what given my background and experiences is reasonable to expect. 
For example, at my current internship they use PowerBI.
